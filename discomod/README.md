# Discomod: Comparing Statistical Tests for Differential Network Analysis of Gene Modules

This study evaluates different statistical methods to identify Differentially Co-expressed Modules (DCMs) in gene networks using Differential Network Analysis (DiNA). We tested a new method, the p-norm difference test (PND), against traditional approaches through simulations and real data analysis. The outcome is the `discoMod` R package, equipped with tools for visualizing networks, testing for DCMs, and clustering genes. Our findings show that PND is an effective alternative to standard methods, as it successfully lowers the false positive rate while keeping a good true positive rate.

 ## Documentation
 This repository contains the implementation of the study on Differential Network Analysis (DiNA) to identify Differentially Co-expressed Modules (DCMs) using various statistical tests, including the newly proposed p-norm difference test (PND). The study involves extensive simulations and analyses on real-world gene expression data to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different methods.
